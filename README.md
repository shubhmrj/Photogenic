## The Problem 💡
Photogeni fundamentally reimagines how we share photos in our increasingly visual world. At its core, it solves a modern digital dilemma we've all experienced but rarely acknowledge - every time we share photos through conventional methods, we're unknowingly creating a storage crisis that impacts both our devices and the cloud infrastructure supporting our digital lives.
Traditional photo sharing follows an outdated "copy-and-distribute" model that made sense in the early digital era but has become woefully inefficient today. When you send vacation photos through WhatsApp or email, here's what really happens behind the scenes:
The original photo sits in your camera roll
A copy gets created in your messaging app's sent folder
Each recipient receives and stores a separate copy
Cloud backups create additional duplicates across multiple services
This multiplication effect becomes staggering when you consider that the average user shares 23 photos per week. For a family of four sharing memories, this translates to hundreds of redundant copies floating across devices and servers - consuming precious storage space, increasing energy usage in data centers, and creating version control nightmares when trying to find "that one good picture" later.
Modern photo sharing creates multiple issues:
- 📦 **Storage bloat** from duplicate photos in chats
- 🔗 **Lost cloud links** that expire or get forgotten
- 📱 **Device storage overload** from multiple copies
- 🔄 **Redundant uploads** to different platforms
- 🧩 **Fragmented editing** across different apps

## Our Solution 🚀
